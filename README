Extra-credit done:
Performance testing - you can find performance.pdf in the /src directory.
Multi-step wildcard - I've registered a route at GET /*/splat/* that prints the splat parameters in a plaintext response.
For the request, GET /first/splat/second/third you'd expect a response of:
```
Here were the splat params from this request:
first
second/third
```
To write your own functions and use splat, you'll need to define a route that casts the Request interface into my HttpRequest implementation, like:
```
String[] splatContent = ((HttpRequest) request).splat();
```
